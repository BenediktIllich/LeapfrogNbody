# LeapfrogNbody
gravitational n-body simulation using a leapfrog integrator

# N-Body-Leapfrog
runs the integration of all n particles over T timesteps. takes in two files for the initial space and velocity distributions (optionally also a list of masses for each particle).

# Generate_N_Body_Setup
samples a given geometry for initial space distribution values. converts the positions into the cartesian coordinates needed by the integrator.

# ConvertSetup
reformats other setup files so they can be used with the integrator
